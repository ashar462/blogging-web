      <div id="title">The Commodification of Minimalism</div>
      <div id="para">Ever notice how everything looks and feels kind of “minimalist” these days?

        Between the recent rise of deconstructed corporate logos to Instagram-worthy interior spaces, hipster-chic clothing, Apple tech products, and the empty white pages of the mobile-friendly web, it seems the minimalist aesthetic is, ironically, everywhere.
        
        And if social media is anything to go by, it seems like everybody who is somebody is in on the whole thing too. All the cool kids are either living out of their neutral-colored backpacks as “digital nomads”, spending their day “living among nature” in the woods, or wading through big, empty, beautiful houses overlooking the streets below.
        
        It’s enough to inspire an urgent desire to spring clean your home or throw out your most treasured possessions.
        
        It’s enough to make you envious.
        
        Speaking as someone who could be considered a minimalist by some accounts, I’d like to think that most of this minimalist uptake is a net positive. Perhaps the required antidote for the consumer culture wreaking havoc on our lives and climate.
        
        But is today’s minimalism really a rejection of all that “stuff” making us miserable and the planet sick? Or is it just consumerism of a different kind? A new product for the privileged to play with and for the rest of us to pine after?</div>
      
      
      
      
      
        <div id="title">The Religion Of Solitude</div>
      <div id="para">"The more powerful and original a mind, the more it will incline towards the religion of solitude.“

        — Aldous Huxley Proper Studies
        
        “All the advantages of Christianity and alcohol; none of their defects.”
        
        — Brave New World
        
        What is that? Why is that? Where is that?
        
        These are my first thoughts. Yet I haven't even asked the main question: Is there any basis for Aldous Huxley’s assertion in reality?
        
        So is it? What ‘true’, the statement by Aldous Huxley? Shall we have a journey into the anatomy of the mind in solitude and in situ? Or do you have something else more pressing to do? Well, I will begin and you can catch up later. It's a bit like catch-up TV except this is catch-up enlightenment from Aldous Huxley.
        
        Aldous Leonard Huxley (26 July 1894–22 November 1963) was a writer, philosopher and explorer of the mind using psychotropic substances such as LSD and mescaline what we now call a Psychonaut. He was a writer of fiction, non-fiction, essays and poems. His mighty works included the iconic and prophetic dystopian novel Brave New World and The Doors of Perception.
        
        An unceasing, questioning man who asked his wife on his deathbed for two intramuscular injections of LSD which she promptly obliged. Huxley departed — all aboard the train for the eternal Self — this life on the same day as President Kennedy was assassinated. There is no doubt he had such a “powerful and original mind” yet his life was hardly one of “solitude” in the sense most of us understand it to mean.
        
        However, Huxley refers to the “religion of solitude” quite specifically. He grew interested in philosophical mysticism after his move to California in 1937 where he was attracted to Vedanta — the Upanishad-centred philosophy — meditation and vegetarianism.
        
        It was here that he wrote The Perennial Philosophy and within it provided the commonalities in Western and Eastern mystic thought. In this work he discusses the great teachings of renowned mystics of the world. Huxley’s book affirmed a sensibility that insists there are realities beyond the generally accepted “five senses” and that there is genuine meaning for…

      <div id="title">Trump and Math</div>
      <div id="para">Facing prosecutions in at least three jurisdictions, it’s likely, if he is not reelected, Trump will be tried, convicted, and sent to prison. I don’t believe this will happen, as a plea deal serves everyone’s interests. Trump and the prosecutors, I speculate, will settle for a lifetime ban on serving in public office in exchange for the resolution of criminal proceedings against him. As the political map comes into focus, a plea deal will emerge as the best outcome for Trump. And as the knock-on effects of imprisoning a former president become a reality, a deal will also become the best (or least bad) outcome for the nation.

        Trump’s Math
        President Trump is an obese 77-year-old male. Any sentence to a prison facility is likely a death sentence. Attorneys general wield the power of possible incarceration. Even more compelling? The prospect of survival — avoiding death behind bars. Incarceration, balanced against a life (post-deal) of golf clubs, sycophants, and porn stars weighs heavily on even the most delusional psyche.
        
        How serious is the threat of prison? As I write this, President Trump has been indicted three times: in New York for tax and reporting violations related to hush money payments; in federal court in Miami for mishandling national security documents and obstructing the investigation into his conduct; and in federal court in D.C. for attempting to subvert the 2020 election. Later this month a fourth is expected, in Georgia, on charges of election tampering. But what is the risk he actually goes to jail? What sounds improbable looks more probable when we do the math.
        
        Federal prosecutors rarely lose: In 2021, 94% of defendants charged with a federal felony were convicted. State and local prosecutors convict at high rates as well — the Atlanta office expected to indict Trump boasts a 90% conviction rate. Of those convicted by the feds, 74% received prison time. In cases for mishandling national security documents specifically, the DOJ regularly obtains multiyear prison sentences. And the documents case against the former president is notable for the weight of the evidence, including audio of him sharing military secrets he admits he hadn’t declassified, the sensitivity of the papers, and his blatant obstruction — offenses the DOJ and courts take very seriously.</div>
